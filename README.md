# CMSC320 Final Project

## Overview

In the professional world a lot of systems are not built with data science in mind because they are either old or companies did not plan to perform analytics on the data. To sucessfully gather and analyze data, data sciencetist must work around existing systems that businesses use to gather and store data. This tutorial will introduce how to process and analyze data from third party business management sites.
A lot of business applications can output reports so I will be focusing on how to use these reports to successfully get information about the company. This can be both simple information about the business but also much more advanced machine learning methods can be employed to have a deeper understanding of how the business runs
